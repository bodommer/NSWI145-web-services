The task of the intermediary is to provide additional option to checking the card verification.
If the checking person knows that the card won't pass (the card holder is not from that university
or is someone with no valid student card), they can manually override this compulsory check to make
sure the card validation passes.
The header of the request contains behavior definition and the attribute 'override' defines whether
the result should be overridden if it is negative. This override is, of course, properly logged.
